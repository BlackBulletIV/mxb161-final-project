This is a final project for MXB161 at QUT. It is a relatively simple simulation of cell life and propagation across land. It outputs visual data from the simulation to up to four different videos.

Notes:

* earth_img_demo.png, and img_demo.m were used only for the in-class image processing demo.
* fertility_small.mat and earth_small.png were used for the in-class cell simulation demo (project.m).
* fertility.mat and earth.png were used for the pregenerated demo shown in the video.
